# Cristian Estarellas ‚Äì Academic Profile

<p align=justify>
My career in <strong>physics</strong> began in 2011 at the University of the Balearic Islands. During my third year, I joined a research group studying nanostructures and quantum cables, leading to publications in 2014 and 2015. After completing a <strong>Master in Complex Systems</strong> (2016), I was awarded the CAIB grant from the Balearic Islands government to pursue a <strong>PhD in Physics</strong>, specializing in computational neuroscience.

During my PhD, I specialized in <strong>computational modeling of neural circuits</strong> in the hippocampus, with a particular focus on the inhibitory function of interneurons in the Dentate Gyrus. I collaborated with the <strong>Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante</strong>, where I gained expertise in electrophysiology experiments (in vivo & in vitro). Additionally, I worked with the Nonlinear Dynamics, Nonlinear Optics, and Lasers (DNOLL) group at the <strong>Polytechnic University of Catalonia</strong>, investigating neuronal encoding, processing, and transmission‚Äîa study published in Chaos Journal.

Following my PhD completion in November 2021, I started as <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> at the Medical University of Vienna, as part of the <strong>FOR5159 consortium</strong>. My work focuses on behavioral experiments with animals, multi-unit recordings, and RNN optimization, in collaboration with the <strong>Central Institute of Mental Health in Mannheim</strong>. In this role, I aim to decode electrophysiological data to uncover the underlying dynamics of behavioral flexibility.
